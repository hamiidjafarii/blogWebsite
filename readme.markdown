<h1 text-align="center"><h1>Personal Blog Website</h1>

<p text-align="center"><project-description>
I have designed and developed my website recently and then I received a request for a personal blog website. It was an opportunity for me to challenge myself with what I have learnt so far in PHP, HTML, CSS. Its my first experience of designing and developing a WordPress theme. I would be grateful if you as a developer help me to solve the possible issues, if you find any.
To run the code, you will need to download the project's files. Click the green button on the top right of the repository named "Code". Download the project on your computer and then extract the zip file. Please go into the folder and create a zip file of the folder that is named the theme. Select the zip file as your theme on WordPress.
